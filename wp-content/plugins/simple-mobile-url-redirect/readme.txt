A simple mobile redirect plugin for those who use a separate website URL for their mobile content.  Simply put in the full path URL and you are ready to send users to your mobile-only content.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `mobile-redirect.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've disabled the plugin but the redirect is still happening, how do I fix this? =

First, check if this is happening on another computer. If not, the redirect is simply cached on your machine. Clear the cache and you should be fine.

If the redirect remains everywhere, check if there are other redirect scripts running.

= Can I link to pages inside of my site? =

(v1.1) Yes, but mobile users will be stuck only viewing that page as the plugin will redirect them back there if they navigate away.  
You will still need to use a full path as well, and make sure the URL is exactly as what will be redirected including / at the end if necessary. 
As of v1.2, you can use the Redirect Once option to redirect users to an internal page on their first visit, afterward they'll be able to browse the site normally.

= Does this redirect iPad traffic? =

Yes, there is an option to redirect all tablet traffic.
